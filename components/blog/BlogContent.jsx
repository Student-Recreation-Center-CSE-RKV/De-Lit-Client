Another therapy session {laughing_with_eyes_closed}. Since we had informed them that this was to be the last session of the semester, they were waiting with expectant eyes. We had a guest from R20 batch who readily became a part of the activity the coordinators from R21 had planned.<br /><br />The activity for the day was to write a letter to their past and future selves. Every narrative resonated the hurdles they faced, experiences that molded them, and the pleasures they had, and advising their future versions to love themselves and to be strong whatever may come. Everyone had a deeper and emotional story to tell. People bared their strongest concerns coming out of their so-called **Shell of Scrutiny** they'd confined themselves to. <br /><br />It was a period (.) to the first chapter of R22 as members and R21 as coordinators.<br /><br />*"Not even a second goes by throughout the week without the thought of the next session."<br />"My dawgs inquire me about the session I come from everytime."<br />"I float in excitement on my way to the club."<br />"I've come to know and interact with seniors who helped me through different walks of life."<br /> "har baar club mein dil garden garden ho jaata hai"*<br />These pearls were annotated by the newest members of our *coterie*. `

It doth spill forth its fervor, to spread its roots wide, reaching to all corners of the earth. <br /><br />As a <sup>3</sup>humble<sub>2</sub> poet and scribe, I do foresee this club to flourish and become a most glorious company, extending its majesty to the very dawn of creation.`
